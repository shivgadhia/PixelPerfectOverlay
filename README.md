Pixel Perfect Overlay
===================

A simple app which overlays an image (for example a mockup or screenshot) onto your device's screen.

Be sure to pick a screenshot which has both the Android Navigation and Status bars

### Features:
* Overlay's an image over the whole screen
* Applies an opacity level to the image - so you can see what is behind it
* Applies a Red tint to the image
* Adjustments made to support screenshots which include status and nav bars.

### Rationale:
When attempts to educate designers and product owners about the invalidity of trying to achieve "Pixel Perfect" Android screen designs fails,
and you decide it's easier to just bite the bullet and apply non-[48dp Rhythm](http://developer.android.com/design/style/metrics-grids.html#48dp-rhythm) paddings and margins, 
here is a tool that might help!
